#### Artist (business) goals: 
After interviewing Jamie, I determined that their goals for the site are as follows: 

- To provide a good experience to the users

- To display Jamie’s best artwork to viewers

- To give the viewers background information about the artist and what they’re about, a long with what their future plans are

- To give viewers a way of connecting with Jamie 

- To help to create an audience for Jamie’s artwork

## User Requirements and Expectations 

The website will feature mainly visual content,  as the audience will contain majority visual people. The other elements within the page will be straightforward, easy to use and flow nicely creating a balance between visual imagery and information. Collectors or businesses will be able to easily find contact information on the site. 

The content on the pages will be easy to navigate around. There will be the navigation bar at the top which clearly labels the different areas of the website. The information on the navbar will be organised in order of user importance. As well as this text areas within the pages will give written ques to were the views should check out next. Such as “commisions are now open” There will be also be a link to the contact form in the footer as well as links to social media and contact details. All this will lead to the user having a good fluid experience on the website. 

Art by Jamie is a great site for it’s audience because it displays information relevant to the users expectations, all three audiences have well defined and clear pathways that they can take to reach the information they need. The website is structured in a way that priorities the importance of information to to the user. There are also multiple pathways that users can take to reach their end goals(cta points). This makes the site informal an increases user engagement with the different pages.

## Design Choices 

When designing this site, I wanted to create something that showcased jamie’s unique and funny personality to the viewer. Originally I started off with a purple and grey colour scheme. However, this was really boring and didn’t achieve the goal that i wanted it to. I had the idea of using one of Jamie’s pieces titled “my creepy children” as a basis for the colour palette on the site. I extracted the colours for the palette using Adobe Colour Wheel. I then experimented with different colour combinations on the website until I found one that I really linked and more importantly Jamie really liked to. 

### Colors: 


### Body: 000000:

 This created a background that made the foreground colours pop and stand out. 

### Header and navigation: rgba (158,230,148,0.8)

This green added a nice contrast with the white background and black text. 

### Title, form and about information sections: E9A2CC

This pink again created a nice contrast with the black text colour and really helped to highlight sections. 

### Footer: F2CC0C

The colour used in the footer is the one that I am most conflicted about, although it does add some nice diferansiation from the pink and green. The black text also looks nice over the yellow. 

### Text: 000000, FFFFFF

I used black for all the text on the site keeping consistency. I added white to the hover puedos to contrast with black text. 

### Fonts: 

I used google fonts Creepster and Arvo on the site. Creepster added a lot of personality to the headings and titles. It also really complimented the colours and imagery of jamies Art. Whilst the Arvo created a nice ballance and added elegance to the written information sections making it easy for the user to read. 

### Imagery: 

The images on the site all came from Jamie, I choice to use ‘my creepy children’ as the hero image because I wanted it to be the first thing users see when they go onto the site. It injects a lot of personality from the get go, triggering an emotional response from the viewer and visually telling them what Art by Jamie is all about. The images in the gallery where selected by jamie. They were organised into different sections for the different types of artwork jamie wanted to show. This creates a well organised, structured,  visual information layout.  I used the logo and the image in the about section to put a face onto Art by Jamie, creating another emotional response from the user. The image selected in the about section was also used quite literally as a way of painting a picture to show the user what Art by Jamie is all about. In the footer I used easily recognisable icons so that the user can see Jamie’s external social links in a clean and practical manor the icons came from Font Awesome. 

### Styling: 

All the containers appart from the maps were given a border radius, creating a slight curve that was move aestheic, the border styles were set to dashed with a 3px size to create the impression that they could be cut out or had been stuck in. This creates a nice consistent art book style. The maps were set to container fluid because I wanted them to stand out and contrast against the other containers. There is also a breakout image on each page to help to break up visual and written information. This results in a more aesthetic, and fluid website. I decided not to include a map on the gallery page because I didn’t want it to distract the user from the visual information in the gallery. I added a pseudo to the images in the gallery to limit the amount of written text on the page. I added the content for each pseudo as names of the pieces so that the user can click on the images to view their details. I decided against adding this to the larger images on the index and about page because I felt that it was too distracting for the user.
