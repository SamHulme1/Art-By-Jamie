#### Artist (business) goals: 
After interviewing Jamie, I determined that their goals for the site are as follows: 

- To provide a good experience to the users

- To display Jamie’s best artwork to viewers

- To give the viewer's background information about the artist and what they’re about, along with what their future plans are

- To give viewers a way of connecting with Jamie 

- To help to create an audience for Jamie’s artwork
---
## User Requirements and Expectations 

The website will feature mainly visual content,  as the audience will contain the majority of visual people. The other elements within the page will be straightforward, easy to use and flow nicely creating a balance between visual imagery and information. Collectors or businesses will be able to easily find contact information on the site. 

The content on the pages will be easy to navigate around. There will be a navigation bar at the top which clearly labels the different areas of the website. The information on the navbar will be organised in order of user importance. As well as this text areas within the pages will give written ques about where the users should check out next. Such as “commissions are now open” There will also be a link to the contact form in the footer as well as links to social media and contact details. All this will lead to the user having a good fluid experience on the website. 

Art by Jamie is a great site for its audience because it displays information relevant to the user's expectations, all three audiences have well-defined and clear pathways that they can take to reach the information they need. The website is structured in a way that prioritises the importance of information to the user. There are also multiple pathways that users can take to reach their end goals(cta points). This makes the site informal and increases user engagement with the different pages.

## Design Choices 

When designing this site, I wanted to create something that showcased Jamie's unique and funny personality to the viewer. Originally I started off with a purple and grey colour scheme. However, this was really boring and didn’t achieve the goal that I wanted it to. I had the idea of using one of Jamie’s pieces titled “my creepy children” as a basis for the colour palette on the site. I extracted the colours for the palette using Adobe Colour Wheel. I then experimented with different colour combinations on the website until I found one that I really linked and more importantly Jamie really liked too. 

---
### Colors: 

![colour-pallete](assets/img/readme-images/colors.png)

### Body: #000000:

 This created a background that made the foreground colours pop and stand out. 

### Header and navigation: rgba (158,230,148,0.8)

This green added a nice contrast with the white background and black text. 

### Title, form and about information sections: #E9A2CC

This pink again created a nice contrast with the black text colour and really helped to highlight sections. 

### Footer: #F2CC0C

The colour used in the footer is the one that I am most conflicted about, although it does add some nice differentiation from the pink and green. The black text also looks nice over the yellow. 

### Text: #000000, #E9A2CC

I used black for all the text on the site keeping consistency. I added pink to the hover pseudo to contrast with the black text. 

---
### Fonts:
![font-creepster](assets/img/readme-images/font-creepster.png)
![font-arvo](assets/img/readme-images/font-arvo.png) 

I used google fonts Creepster and Arvo on the site. Creepster added a lot of personality to the headings and titles. It also really complimented the colours and imagery of Jamie's Art. Whilst the Arvo created a nice balance and added elegance to the written information sections making it easy for the user to read. 

---
### Imagery: 

The images on the site all came from Jamie, I chose to use ‘my creepy children’ as the hero image because I wanted it to be the first thing users see when they go onto the site. It injects a lot of personality from the get-go, triggering an emotional response from the viewer and visually telling them what Art by Jamie is all about. The images in the gallery were selected by Jamie. They were organised into different sections for the different types of artwork Jamie wanted to show. This creates a well-organised, structured,  visual information layout.  I used the logo and the image in the about section to put a face onto Art by Jamie, creating another emotional response from the user. The image selected in the about section was also used quite literally as a way of painting a picture to show the user what Art by Jamie is all about. In the footer, I used easily recognisable icons so that the user can see Jamie’s external social links in a clean and practical manner the icons came from Font Awesome. 

---
### Styling: 

All the containers apart from the maps were given a border-radius, creating a slight curve that was more aesthetic, the border styles were set to dashed with a 3px size to create the impression that they could be cut out or had been stuck in. This creates a nice consistent artbook style. The map was set to container fluid because I wanted it to stand out and contrast against the other containers. There is also a breakout image on each page to help to break up visual and written information. This results in a more aesthetic, and fluid website. I added a pseudo to the images in the gallery to limit the amount of written text on the page. I added the content for each pseudo as names of the pieces so that the user can click on the images to view their details. I decided against adding this to the larger images on the index and about page because I felt that it was too distracting for the user. 

---
## WireFrames: 

![wireframes](assets/img/readme-images/art-by-jamie-wireframe.png)

Here are the wireframes for all four pages of Art By Jame on Desktop, Mobile and Tablet. Although my final side differs slightly from these wireframes. They helped me to create consistency across the site.

### Future Features:

In the future the site will have a blog section for more interaction with the audience and the Youtube button in the footer will link directly to Jamie's Youtube channel. It doesn't at the moment because they don't have one but I know that they are planning on creating one in the near future. I will also add an artist C.V to the page once they have gained more experience. If I'd had more time I would have also liked to put the images in a carousel so that they could be displayed larger when clicked on. There will also be an error 404 page in the future. I had to remove what I had developed for this due to the time limit. 

### Naming Conventions and Structure of Files 

- The files on the site have been named consistently and structured into relevant sections
- All names contain lowercasing and no special characters
- The images have been organised into different sections. 
    - The first contains images that are the most important on the site: logo, favicon, hero image and about image(page defining images). I wanted them displayed outside of the lower files. 
    - The lower files (acrylics, digital and drawing, oil, readme images) have been organised in this way to increase readability and to categorise them into different sections 
    -where an image has a number after e.g hands-1 this indicates the series number of the painting so 1 is the first etc. 
    - I have also left images in these files that could be used in the future if the gallery was expanded or on additional pages etc, adding an element of future-proofing to the site.

### Browser testing 

The site has been tested on Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Firefox and Safari. 
The site performed well on all browsers, however, there was an issue with the text being selected on the hover effects in Safari. 
## Bugs 
Here are some of the bugs that I've found and fixed throughout development: 

1. There was a strange _ when hovering over the Instagram logo, this was caused by a gap in front of the span.
2. initially the logo was being displayed behind the navbar. I fixed this by adding float left.
3. The images overlapped their containers. I fixed this by setting overlap to hidden 
4. I had to use some inline CSS with the logo to change the padding-left to 4px. For some reason, it wouldn't let me if I targeted it in the style sheet so I did this.
5. The logo image wasn't displaying correctly initially. I fixed this by correcting the file path.
6. Because I wanted content in the Cloudflare effects, This didn't work as expected so I had to create my own overlay for the images, this fixed this issue and I removed Cloudflare effects from the site afterwards. 
7. On smaller screens the gallery images didn't display how I wanted them to due to the set height of 300px. I fixed this by targeting the image ids and the gallery image class so that the height could be set to 100%. This resulted in a nice clean layout for smaller screens. 
8. On really small screens the links in the navbar would spill out. I fixed this by targeting them on media screen to scale them down. 
9. In the gallery the hover effect would flicker when the element was hovered over instead of displaying correctly. I fixed this by using opacity on the overlay instead of display. 
10. In safari the user can select the text in the gallery hover elements, the hover elements still work correctly but the text is selected on clicking.To fix this I had to create a paragraph element that only appeared on smaller devices. The hover effect was also disabled on smaller devices. This isn't an ideal fix but without javascript it's the best I could do. Shout out to tutors James and Christine for pointing me in the right direction to fix this. I also looked at the follow information on Stackoverflow and W3schools:
